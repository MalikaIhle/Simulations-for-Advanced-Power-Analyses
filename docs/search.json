For instance, check that you only get a significant result in 5% of the simulations (if alpha = 0.05) when you simulated no effect; and that you get at a significant result in 80% of the simulations (if you targeted a power of 80%) when you simulated an effect\n\nHere are the type of models we will cover, you can pick and choose what is relevant to you!\n\n[LM](LM.qmd)\nGLM\nLMM\nGLMM\nSEM\n\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"
