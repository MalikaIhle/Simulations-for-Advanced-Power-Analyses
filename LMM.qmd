In order to keep this chapter at a reasonable length, we focus on how to simulate the mixed effects/multi-level model and spend less time discussing how to arrive at plausible parameter values. Please read Chapters [1](LM1.qmd) and [2](LM2.qmd) for multiple examples where the parameter values are derived from (a) the literature (e.g., bias-corrected meta-analyses), (b) pilot data, or (c) plausibility constraints.

Furthermore, we'll use the techniques described in the Chapter ["Bonus: Optimizing R code for speed"](optimizing_code.qmd). If you wonder about the unknown commands in the code, please read the bonus chapter to learn how to considerably speed up your code!
